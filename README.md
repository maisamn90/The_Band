The Band website 
===================


Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.

The website is one-page which allow the fans to reach whatever they need to know about the band with scrolling only. The first section will be the header with sticky navigation for easy move around sections. In additional to full screen banner images of with The Band slogan. The second section is about section. This one has a brief text about the band history and journey as well as a photo of the band. Then, the next section will promote the band’s music in an audio and video format. 

There is events section to promote dates and locations of upcoming event with image of previous event. The website will consist of links to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube links and testimonials for fans on social media. There will be a contact section where the user can contact the band directly to hire them for their events and parties.

UX
---------
 **As a user, I want to use the website to:**

> - listen to the band’s music and watch videos.
> - find links to their social media and other media pages (i.e. YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram).
> - Check the upcoming event date and locations.
> - Contact the band directly to hire them for my event.

Before I started the website, I draw a sketch for the web page by paper and pen.
I decided to make this website one-page website to go around the web page easily and smoothly.
Also I decided to design the events part as a costume design timeline.

Features
--------
In further discuss the features, I will speak in details what each section will contain.

#### The website will have 6 sections in additional to header and footer

> 1.	Banner Image of the latest event and slogan of the band
> 2.	Sticky header with navbar and logo 
> 3.	About section gives a brief about the band history and journey 
> 4.	Media section will contain Audio clips and Video clip

> 6.	Social section has a slider on fans reviews and testimonials for social media and social media links for (Facebook, twitter, Instagram and YouTube)

### Existing Features

I used html semantics for the structure in the web-page I made the navigation bar stick in the with links to each section to reach it easily so the user will never be lost when he going around the web page. The banner image will be full screen image in all screen sizes. In media section will have audio samples and latest released with images of the albums and option for download audio form Spotify and iTunes.  Also, there is a video clip of the band. 

In event section I added a costume made timeline section to display the events in elegant and clear way with images about previous images and the date and location of the upcoming events. Testimonial section is a bootstrap carousal, this will save species and allow to add as many reviews as we wanted.


Technologies Used
---
> -	Html5 semantic to clearly describe it’s meaning in a human and machine-readable way
> - CSS3 is makes me spend less time hacking CSS and HTML code to work in IE and more time crafting the design. For example, importing external open source library (hover.css and Animation CSS) 
> - Bootstrap 4 to use grid system and make use of their components.
> - Fontawesome icons free library 

Testing on different screen sizes
-----
> - All sections have been tested.
> - In mobile version all columns and content are stacked on top of each other, and are consistently to the user when scrolling.
> - In events section the timeline blocks designed to align to the left in mobile version. In this case the text and images will appears in proper size.
> - On wider screens, the content is more spread out, with more columns/content aligned next to each other.
> - Content is also not too spread out, as I utilized the Bootstrap offset classes (on the largest screen sizes) for the main section.
> - I consistently tested the page in development for Chrome in all screen sizes.
> - I commit the code to GitHub after finishing with each section.

Deployment
----
> - I first set up a GitHub repository on my GitHub account. I named it “The_Band”.
> - After my first stage of developing my website on Cloud9, I deployed it to the GitHub repository.
> - First, I pushed my index page with html structure and CSS file.
> - I set up GitHub as a master branch, to use GitHub page.

> -	The audio clips uploaded in media section are provided by code institute
